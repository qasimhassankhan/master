Qasim,

Please convert the following email text to HTML based upon affiliate site style. Like you can create job detail sort of box style to present the data so that we could send html email instead of text email. We already have the html of job detail page but what you need to do is to write inline style for this email since html emails do not use external css file. It doesnt have to be tok fancy but simple tabular style like we have in our afffiliate site. I would need this email by Monday.
