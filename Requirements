I need instant changes. How can I keep on doing it on Skype?
I told you I am not available next 2 days too.
You must take leave from the office and spend tomorrow in our office. I can't be more uncertain about the pending work.
I modified it, update it in your folder.

Use this menu for the main site. (Keep user pages the way you already have) but below user pages, follow the menu shown in screenshot
Copy User management, Driver Management, Car Management pages from mgmt. to  main site (they wil remain there as well) but here just hide "Affliate" drop down list in those pages
Don't need to mention JOB DETAILS page, it should be linked in Manage Jobs grid.

"Select Page" and "Select Control"

-===========================--
These are all cosmetic changes. Please finish them today and call me for any questions. 
///=============================//
I checked Reservation pages
their layout is merged but their functionality is not working???
I checked your folders but you have not moved the scripts associated with its working
I have further shrinked the reservation and confirmation pages today, let me send you its updated files which are very less now and can easily be integrated
did you change only CSS or made html changes too in reservation and confirmation?
these are only content area of reservation/confirmation pages with full functionality, move it to lcom so that both pages are working
currently in your sent code, I can't go next from Pickup address.
---------------
Manage Jobs and Job Detail pages need to work on mobile. YOu did it last time but need to refresh if they are still working fine or not.
I also need to implement them in developed pages so need to know what needs to be done 
I am constantly telling you to visit office and wind it up and you are constantly denying it and not picking up calls and replying in skype as and when you want. I don't understand what you are up to. 
I wont be available at night so you have to come in day and finish up everything. Those which I listed above, you can do anywhere but for quick fixes on website, you must come.
I'm repeating it for hundredth's time that I need to finish it everything this week and it cant be delayed any further.
I'm leaving office from now and will call you around 2pm. You better be prepared to visit office then.
