                              <p>Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access.

                              <p>You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Limousine.com Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Limousine.com services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Limousine.com or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web privately using Chrome in Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used.</p>
                              <h4>We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services</h4>
                              <p>We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Limousine.com collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.</p>
                              <p>When you’re not signed in to a Limousine.com Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This helps us do things like maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions.</p>
